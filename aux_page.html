          <div id="skills-content-left-top">I thrive in relationships and a work environments where <strong>
            structured communication</strong> is built into the routine (e.g. daily stand ups, weekly retrospectives, etc).  My abilities as a <strong>listener, writer, and verbal communicator</strong> serve to cultivate effective group dynamics that enable these environments.  Also, I am an avid <strong>drummer</strong> with a sense of rhythm can both get people moving' on the dance floor and carry over into the workplace as a an ability to establish <strong>tempo</strong> and <strong>unity</strong> among coworkers and clients.</div>

          <div id="skills-content-left-bottom">I am a believer in leaving things better than the way I found them.  <strong>Considering future use and maintenance</strong> is of the utmost importance whether it is crafting a code structure, designing a user interface, or packing-out my trash when I camp.

          <div id="skills-content-bottom">Have you ever been on a website where time flew by without notice?  I believe this happens because of a perceived <strong>human connection</strong> and <strong>good design.</strong>  Using my design skills an amiable personality I strive to create experiences that make peoples' days just a little bit easier and more enjoyable.  Also, as I grow in technical knowledge of the web, it is a personal goal to <strong>continually foster relationships</strong> with my clients and end users, so as to keep my designs aligned with their needs.

          <div id="skills-content-right-bottom">Since my earliest years I have been a <strong>tinkerer</strong>, a builder, just plain <strong>curious</strong> about the way things work.  This <strong>passion for building</strong> remains with me and will be an asset in my pursuit of building amazing user experiences.

          <div id="circle-title-right-top">Design</div>
          <div id="skills-content-right-top">I believe that <strong>good design can change the world.</strong>  To achieve this change is not all about skill, but also about how a designer thinks.  A designer must have the ability to combine <strong>empathy</strong> for the context of a problem, <strong>creativity</strong> in the generation of insights and solutions, and <strong>rationality</strong> to analyze and fit solutions to the context.  My training and life experiences have introduced me to these qualities which prepare me well for AUX.</div>
