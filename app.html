          </div>
          <div id="circle-title-left">Communication</div>
          <div id="skills-content-left-top">I thrive in relationships and work environments where <strong>
            structured communication</strong> is built into the routine (e.g. daily stand ups, weekly retrospectives, etc).  My abilities as a <strong>listener, writer, and verbal communicator</strong> cultivate effective group dynamics that enable these environments.  Also, I am an avid <strong>drummer.</strong>  My sense of rhythm can get people movin' on the dance floor and carry over into the workplace to help establish <strong>tempo</strong> and <strong>unity</strong> among coworkers and clients.</div>

          <div id="circle-title-left">Sustainability</div>
          <div id="skills-content-left-bottom">I believe in leaving things better than the way I found them.  <strong>Considering future use and maintenance</strong> is of the utmost importance whether crafting a code structure, designing a user interface, or packing-out my trash when camping.  As an apprentice at Fresh Tilled Soil, I hope to learn best practices of how to make front-end code and designs innovative and sustainable!</div>

          <div id="circle3">
          </div>
          <div id="circle-title-bottom">Customer Experience</div>
          <div id="skills-content-bottom">Have you ever been on a website where time flew by without notice?  I believe this happens because of <strong>human connection</strong> and <strong>good design.</strong>  Using my design skills and amiable personality I strive to create experiences that make peoples' days just a little bit easier and more enjoyable.  As I grow in technical knowledge, it is my personal goal to <strong>continuously foster relationships</strong> with clients and end-users, so as to keep my designs agile and aligned with their needs.</div>

        <div id="skills4">
          <div id="circle4"></div>
          <div id="circle-title-right-bottom">Building</div>
          <div id="skills-content-right-bottom">Since my earliest years I have been a <strong>tinkerer</strong>, a builder, and just plain <strong>curious</strong> about the way things work.  My <strong>passion for building</strong> will be an asset in my pursuit of creating amazing user experiences.  Also, if anyone in the office needs a new deck on their house, I might just be the man for the job!</div>

        <div id="skills5">
          <div id="circle5"></div>
          <div id="circle-title-right-top">Design</div>
          <div id="skills-content-right-top">I believe that <strong>good design can change the world.</strong>  Achieving this change is not all about skill, but also about how a designer thinks.  A designer must combine <strong>empathy</strong> for the context of a problem, <strong>creativity</strong> in the generation of solutions, and <strong>rationality</strong> to tailor solutions to the context.  My training and life experiences have grounded me in these qualities, preparing me well to work with Fresh Tilled Soil.</div>
